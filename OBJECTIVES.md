1. Compare the fixation stability of three different implants:
	1. [[Dual plate]]
	2. [[Novel anatomical plate]]
	3. [[T-plate]]
2. Compare three FE solvers:
	1. Novel bone [[poroelasticity]] program (use [[PETSc]] and code based on [[C language]])
	2. [[MARC]]
	3. [[Salome-Meca]] (Integrate with [[PETSc]])

**Question**
1. Could I use PETSc for both novel and Salome-Meca? 
	1. If yes, than what's the difference between these two?
	2. If no, should I neglect the effect of poroelasticity on Salome-Meca?
	3. Can this number 3 works once I return to Windows?
