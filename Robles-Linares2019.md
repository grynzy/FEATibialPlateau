Objectives:
Present a novel algorithm for generating [[in-silico]] [[biomimetic]] models of a cortical bone microstructure towards manufacturing biomimetic bone via additive manufacturing

Modeling based on:
- Density
- Inclination
- Size range of:
	- Osteon
	- Haversian and Volkmann's canals

Porosity = 13.37 - 21.49% ~ same with models of of healthy and osteoporotic bone --> *are this also in-silico?*

> "However, the pursuit by the scientific community of alternatives to autologous or allogeneic bone grafts such as entirely synthetic bone graft strategies has focused on relatively simple lattices that do not recreate the convoluted and mutable essence of natural tissue." ([Robles-Linares et al 2019:914](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D88FILCW?page=2))

*Why we need porous bone model ([note on p.914](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D88FILCW?page=2))*



Bone consists of 2 main tissues:
1. The cortical (compact) layer in the outermost region
	- Can be regarded as composite material made of unidirectional fibers called [[osteons]] immersed in matrix made of old surmineralized osteons
2. The cancellous or spongy layer filling the inner section of the bone

**Objectives**
1. Provide brief outline of the current state-of-the-art of cortical bone modeling. --> *what about cancellous?*
2. In-depth analysis of the porposed parametric modeling based on:
	- set of macro and microstructural parameters
3. Build algorithm that dynamically constructs a 3-d bone sample model composed based on number 2
4. By creating healthy and osteoporotic cortical bone conditions, it can show the feasibility of this algorithm for detailed and tunable cortical bone tissue modeling


# Materials and Methods
## Algorithm for Generating the Cortica Bone Models
### Software 
- Free-form surface modeler CAD software (Rhino 6)
- Built-in visual programming language Grasshopper
Coupling these tools --> build generative algorithms for models using standard design tools:
	- point
	- curve sketching
#### *Parameters that is needed to be specified*
Check 
1. Lenght of the model
2. Osteon density
3. Osteon diameter range
4. Inclination angles
5.
