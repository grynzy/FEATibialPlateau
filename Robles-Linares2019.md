Objectives:
Present a novel algorithm for generating [[in-silico]] [[biomimetic]] models of a cortical bone microstructure towards manufacturing biomimetic bone via additive manufacturing

Modeling based on:
- Density
- Inclination
- Size range of:
	- Osteon
	- Haversian and Volkmann's canals

Porosity = 13.37 - 21.49% ~ same with models of of healthy and osteoporotic bone --> *are this also in-silico?*

**Introduction**
Bone consists of 2 main tissues:
1. The cortical (compact) layer in the outermost region
	- Can be regarded as composite material made of unidirectional fibers called [[osteons]] immersed in matrix made of old surmineralized osteons
2. The cancellous or spongy layer filling the inner section of the bone

**Objectives**
1. Provide brief outline of the current state-of-the-art of cortical bone modeling. --> *what about cancellous?*
2. In-depth analysis of the porposed parametric modeling based on:
	- set of macro and microstructural parameters
3. Build algorithm that dynamically constructs a 3-d bone sample model composed based on number 2
4. By creating healthy and osteoporotic cortical bone conditions, it can show the feasibility of this algorithm for detailed and tunable cortical bone tissue modeling
