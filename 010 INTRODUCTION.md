> "However, the pursuit by the scientific community of alternatives to autologous or allogeneic bone grafts such as entirely synthetic bone graft strategies has focused on relatively **simple lattices that do not recreate the convoluted and mutable essence of natural tissue**." ([Robles-Linares et al 2019:914](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D88FILCW?page=2))
