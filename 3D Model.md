How to convert the mesh file? Should I go for coding?

## Image segmentation
SURFDriver --> boundary detection approach
Registered to patient image volumes using vreglocal3d
Binary volume was created from the contour set and iso-surfaced using **In-house Matlab code**

Knee structure were meshed into hexahedral finite elements using the pre-processor of ANSYS 5.6
Meshes created by morphing the template mesh using the registration and transform tools

1. The external geometry of femur has been reconstructed by generating a three-dimensional volume that interpolates the CT scans (point clouds raw data)
2. The results were then imported in the 3Matic for surface and solid meshing opimization

1. The external contour of an intact tibia was reconstructed from CT slices of a patient of 35 years old without apparent pathology. It is thus assumed that the tibia of a patient with various deformation has a similar spatial bone density distribution than a healthy knee.
2. The optimal size of the pixel was 0.39 mm, with a resolution of 512 x 512 pixels 
3. CT transversal slices are obtained every 0.7 mm
4. The 3D geometry was generated by AMIRA
5. It then transferred to PATRAN  for FE mesh generation

Voxel signal intensities were linearly scaled from 0 to 100 with absolute marrow and absolute bone having minimum and maximum values

This generated a 3D BVF map, with each voxel within the BVF map representing the fractional occupancy of bone from the original MR image

Mimics = reconstructed CT data in DICOM format
Geomaggic = smoothing and polishing the surface	

[[Carrerra2015]]
The mesh of the tibia was reconverted into a geometry off NURBS surface

[[dehoust2020biomechanical]]
CT 1 mm slice thickness was performed and the data processed with
1. 3D software #Invesalius
2. #Blender
3. #Solidworks
Applying the #ANSYS designer module #SpaceClaim, after simplifying the surfaces, a volume representation of the tibial bone was created. 
#SpaceClaim allows simulated modifying (cutting etc) of the volume model
Create shrinkage shape of the original tibia and extruded inside so that there is 3 mm cortical thickness medially and laterally
and 2 mm anteriorly, posteriorly, and at the plateau
In the shaft, a 14 mm tube was cut out to simulate the tubular cortical bone
