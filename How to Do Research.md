* This note is inspired by : [How To Research by Overly Sarcastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sigJwoeU6OI)
	1. Go to Wikipedia. Although, All Professor will kill you if you do this. The reason is not about the content. Of course, going to the Wikipedia if you don't understand the content is acceptable. The most important thing from wikipedia is **Check the references**. The References of Wikipedia is extremely concise. You can even get the page number or the content information inside the book or paper
	2. If you don't with Wikipedia, Now it is the time to look for the primary source and secondary source about something. Primary sources is taking an examination directly to the object, But Secondary source look from primary source which will broaden up your understanding about the situation at that time, or the condition or maybe another thing. 
		* **Important note** : The more you know about the context => the more you will able to extrapolate or even understand what is going on => the more you can know what part of the original thing that they might have been minimizing or hide from 'spotlight'. 
		* **Another Important note** : Don't be afraid if you find another sources that stating about your primary sources is negative. **Remember** : If you only looking stuff that you agree, actually you are not doing a research, you just looking a thing to confirm your thinking. 
		* **Another important note 2** : If you get the conflicting sources, it is better to understand the context from your sources, then judge whether your sources is credible or not. **Remember** : Understanding the context behind statement is important.
		* **Addition note from Me** : If you don't understand now, leave it. Read another paper. Because you have the access to go back, although it is annoying to go back. 
	3. If you have a lot of information, and don't know to judge or don't know to connect it. Take a bunch of note from your sources. **Very Important Note : WRITE EVERYTHING IN THE NOTE**. 
		* Write this in your note. Write what they did, put your note in linear timeline, write about writers doing writing. 
		* **Another important note :** Taking note is not relate like "... Ah it is not important to take a note, I am not going to memorize it". No, it is not. **It is about putting all information into one.**
		* **Another important note 2 :** Why taking complete note is needed? Because going back to the original text is tedious and annoying.
	4. Now, after you have your notes. Find the best way to link all of your notes. Find the best fitting curve to connect all the dots into one coherent narrative.
