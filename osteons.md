- 100-250 myumeter runs along longitudinal axis of the bone
- Surrounded by a cement line with a thickness between 1 to 5 myumeter

**Density** = osteon quantity per unit area
10-25 osteons / mm2
--> Increasing density = increasing fracture toughness

Other parameters and properties involved are:
- cement line
- thickness
- elastic modulus
- yield strength
- porosity
- osteon diameter
- hardness
